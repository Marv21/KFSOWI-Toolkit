# KFSOWI-Toolkit
A set of tools to install TWRP and Android on the Kindle Fire 3rd gen (Soho/KFSOWI)

Welcome to the KFSOWI TWRP Tool. 

This tool was developed by Nelson Dane using commands by spudowiar. The reason we have TWRP for the KFSOWI is because of spudowiar. This tool installs TWRP 2.8.7.0. For some reason the newest TWRP doesn’t work and is slow and glitchy.

In order to use this tool you must have:

1. An unrooted Kindle Fire HD 3rd generation soho or KFSOWI running Fire OS 4.5.5.2. (Using this tool will root your device with SuperSU)
 
To find out if you have the KFSOWI, download the app “Android Terminal by linxmap” from the Amazon Appstore. Then run “getprop ro.product.device” without the quotes. Look for “soho” in the text that follows. If you don’t see soho, don’t use this tool or it may brick your device. 

2. Terminal (Mac) or CMW (Windows)

That’s it! You are now ready to install TWRP and SuperSU. 


I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BRICKED DEVICES!!!!! Only use on the KFSOWI. Not on any other device. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Open Terminal or CMW and type cd and then drag the KFSOWI TWRP Tool folder into the Terminal/CMW. Hit return. 

2. Type sh and drag the KFSOWI TWRP Tool.sh file into the Terminal/CMW. Hit return. 

3. Follow the instructions until the end.
